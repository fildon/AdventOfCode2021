Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not a massive company, and I can
only take so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, social media), I
built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and all
of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; preparing a new calendar and a new set of
puzzles each year takes all of my free time for 4-5 months. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

        <h2>--- Day 20: Trench Map ---</h2>
        <p>
          With the scanners fully deployed, you turn their attention to mapping
          the floor of the ocean trench.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you get back the image from the scanners, it seems to just be
          random noise. Perhaps you can combine an image enhancement algorithm
          and the input image (your puzzle input) to clean it up a little.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>..#.#..#####.#.#.#.###.##.....###.##.#..###.####..#####..#....#..#..##..##
#..######.###...####..#..#####..##..#.#####...##.#.#..#.##..#.#......#.###
.######.###.####...#.##.##..#..#..#####.....#.#....###..#.##......#.....#.
.#..#..##..#...##.######.####.####.#.#...#.......#..#.#.#...####.##.#.....
.#..#...##.#.##..#...##.#.##..###.#......#.#.......#.#.#.####.###.##...#..
...####.#..#..#.##.#....##..#.####....##...##..#...#......#.#.......#.....
..##..####..#...#.#.#...##..#.#..###..#####........#..####......#..#

#..#.
#....
##..#
..#..
..###
</code></pre>
        <p>
          The first section is the <em>image enhancement algorithm</em>. It is
          normally given on a single line, but it has been wrapped to multiple
          lines in this example for legibility. The second section is the
          <em>input image</em>, a two-dimensional grid of
          <em>light pixels</em> (<code>#</code>) and
          <em>dark pixels</em> (<code>.</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The image enhancement algorithm describes how to enhance an image by
          <em>simultaneously</em> converting all pixels in the input image into
          an output image. Each pixel of the output image is determined by
          looking at a 3x3 square of pixels centered on the corresponding input
          image pixel. So, to determine the value of the pixel at (5,10) in the
          output image, nine pixels from the input image need to be considered:
          (4,9), (4,10), (4,11), (5,9), (5,10), (5,11), (6,9), (6,10), and
          (6,11). These nine input pixels are combined into a single binary
          number that is used as an index in the
          <em>image enhancement algorithm</em> string.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, to determine the output pixel that corresponds to the
          very middle pixel of the input image, the nine pixels marked by
          <code>[...]</code> would need to be considered:
        </p>
        <pre><code># . . # .
#[. . .].
#[# . .]#
.[. # .].
. . # # #
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Starting from the top-left and reading across each row, these pixels
          are <code>...</code>, then <code>#..</code>, then <code>.#.</code>;
          combining these forms <code>...#...#.</code>. By turning dark pixels
          (<code>.</code>) into <code>0</code> and light pixels (<code>#</code>)
          into <code>1</code>, the binary number <code>000100010</code> can be
          formed, which is <code>34</code> in decimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image enhancement algorithm string is exactly 512 characters long,
          enough to match every possible 9-bit binary number. The first few
          characters of the string (numbered starting from zero) are as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code>0         10        20        30  <em>34</em>    40        50        60        70
|         |         |         |   <em>|</em>     |         |         |         |
..#.#..#####.#.#.#.###.##.....###.<em>#</em>#.#..###.####..#####..#....#..#..##..##
</code></pre>
        <p>
          In the middle of this first group of characters, the character at
          index 34 can be found: <code>#</code>. So, the output pixel in the
          center of the output image should be <code>#</code>, a
          <em>light pixel</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process can then be repeated to calculate every pixel of the
          output image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through advances in imaging technology, the images being operated on
          here are <em>infinite</em> in size. <em>Every</em> pixel of the
          infinite output image needs to be calculated exactly based on the
          relevant pixels of the input image. The small input image you have is
          only a small region of the actual infinite input image; the rest of
          the input image consists of dark pixels (<code>.</code>). For the
          purposes of the example, to save on space, only a portion of the
          infinite-sized input and output images will be shown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The starting input image, therefore, looks something like this, with
          more dark pixels (<code>.</code>) extending forever in every direction
          not shown here:
        </p>
        <pre><code>...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
.....#..#......
.....#.........
.....##..#.....
.......#.......
.......###.....
...............
...............
...............
...............
...............
</code></pre>
        <p>
          By applying the image enhancement algorithm to every pixel
          simultaneously, the following output image can be obtained:
        </p>
        <pre><code>...............
...............
...............
...............
.....##.##.....
....#..#.#.....
....##.#..#....
....####..#....
.....#..##.....
......##..#....
.......#.#.....
...............
...............
...............
...............
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Through further advances in imaging technology, the above output image
          can also be used as an input image! This allows it to be enhanced
          <em>a second time</em>:
        </p>
        <pre><code>...............
...............
...............
..........#....
....#..#.#.....
...#.#...###...
...#...##.#....
...#.....#.#...
....#.#####....
.....#.#####...
......##.##....
.......###.....
...............
...............
...............
</code></pre>
        <p>
          Truly incredible - now the small details are really starting to come
          through. After enhancing the original input image twice,
          <code><em>35</em></code> pixels are lit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start with the original input image and apply the image enhancement
          algorithm twice, being careful to account for the infinite size of the
          images. <em>How many pixels are lit in the resulting image?</em>
